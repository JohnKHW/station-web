Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A &quot;complete&quot; computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for &quot;full&quot; operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster. </description><courses><course><identifier>3</identifier><title>XML</title><description>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The World Wide Web Consortium&#39;s XML 1.0 Specification of 1998 and several other related specifications—all of them free open standards—define XML.&#13;
&#13;
The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services.&#13;
&#13;
Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages, while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.</description></course></courses></subject>
